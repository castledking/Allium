version: 0.1.3a
# This is the version of the language file.
# Currently only used to remove deprecated
# keys from this file on load.

# All error messages are translating the
# last color in your error-prefix and
# adding it after each placeholder use.
# This saves you time from having to
# type &c each time.
#
# For example if your error-prefix is
# error-prefix: "<gradient:#CD2B39:#B82E3A>Error:</gradient><red>"
#
# Then <red> will be added after each
# placeholder use.
#
# For example:
# player-not-found: "Player &7{name} was not found!"
#
# Results in:
# Error: Player &7player&c was not found!
#
# Available color support:
# Color codes: &0-&9, &a-&f, &l, &o, &r
# 1.16+ hex/gradients are supported.
# MiniMessage support: <gradient:#000000:#ffffff>Text</gradient>
# NOTE: You can't use color codes in MiniMessage.

core-prefix: "<gradient:#B2C3EE:#ADF3FD>Core</gradient>"
error-prefix: "<gradient:#CD2B39:#B82E3A>Error:</gradient><red>"
unknown-locale: "Translation for &7{key} &8(&7{lang} &8| &7{country}&8) &ccould not be found!"

#==========================================#

# These correspond to the placeholders used
# throughout this language file. You can
# change the colors to your liking.

styles:
  error:
    # This is used for error messages throughout the plugin.
    #
    # Example format:
    # {error-prefix}{message-color}Player {placeholder-color}player{message-color} # was not found!
    #
    # The message-color will override the last color in error-prefix.
    # You can also add your own colors per-message in the Commands section.
    message-color: "&c" # (e.g. Error: &cPlayer &7player&c was not found!)
    placeholder-color: "&7" # (e.g. Error: &cPlayer &7player&c was not found!)
    parentheses-color: "&8" # (e.g. Error: &cEnchantment &7Sharpness &cexceeds maximum level. Limiting to &8(&7{maxLevel}&8)&c.)
  

  state:
    # These are used for boolean values.
    #
    # Example format:
    # Flying set to {true} -> Flying set to &a&nenabled
    # Flying set to {false} -> Flying set to &c&ndisabled
    true: "&a&n" # or enabled
