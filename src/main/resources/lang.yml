# All error messages are translating the
# last color in your error-prefix and
# adding it after each placeholder use.
# This saves you time from having to
# type &c each time.
#
# For example if your error-prefix is
# error-prefix: "<gradient:#CD2B39:#B82E3A>Error:</gradient><red>"
#
# Then <red> will be added after each
# placeholder use.
#
# For example:
# player-not-found: "Player &7{name} was not found!"
#
# Results in:
# Error: Player &7player&c was not found!
#
# Available color support:
# Color codes: &0-&9, &a-&f, &l, &o, &r
# 1.16+ hex/gradients are supported.
# MiniMessage support: <gradient:#000000:#ffffff>Text</gradient>
# NOTE: You can't use color codes in MiniMessage.
